# ng-phx 2017 livecode

This project contains the final version of my live coding session. It should be use for reference only. The material here is outdated (from an early alpha version of AngularFire2 and beta version of Functions)

For learning, visit [AngularFire2](https://github.com/angular/angularfire2)'s getting started guide, and the [Cloud Functions samples](https://github.com/firebase/functions-samples).

Visit [katowulf.com/ngphx](katowulf.com/ngphx) to see the presentation.
